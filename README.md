# Hey there! 👋 I'm Paulo Victor

Just a student at 42 Lisboa trying to figure out how to code without breaking everything.

## About Me 🌍

I'm studying at 42 and spending way too much time debugging C code. But hey, at least I'm learning stuff along the way!

## My Goal? 🎯

Become good enough at programming so I can actually build cool stuff and maybe even get hired someday. Also hoping to meet other people who like coding as much as I do!
